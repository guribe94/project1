Light and Crisp Waffles,1,"In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.Make a well in center and add in the butter and eggs. Whisk to combine with part of the flour.Pour in the milk slowly and whisk continually to get a smooth batter (but a few lumps won't kill anyone). The batter will resemble pancake batter.Cover and refrigerate 1 hour. (The batter will then keep for a day or two, but it gives best results after 1 hour.) Whisk again before using.Preheat the waffle iron (on mine, the ideal temp is 190C or 375F). Grease if necessary (mine is non-stick) and pour the batter in with a small ladle. Each waffle mold should be filled enough that the waffle will rise to the top, but not so much that the dough will overflow. It may take a couple of tries to get the amount just right for your waffle iron; make sure you remember what that is for subsequent batches.Cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until the waffles are golden brown. To get a sense of how the cooking is going, watch the steam that escapes from the iron; it will lessen significantly when the waffles are almost ready. At that point, you can open the waffle iron carefully to check on the color of the waffles (if you open the waffle iron too early, you risk having your waffles split from the middle).Let stand for 2 minutes on a wire rack before serving with confectioner's sugar, maple syrup, whipped cream, chestnut cream, chocolate sauce, chocolate shavings, etc."

Keep whisking until the milk mixture is smooth (aside from the chunks of garlic).Let the milk mixture thicken a bit, then add in the parmesan cheese and whisk until its melted in. Sauce will start to thicken. Add in the chopped artichokes, and frozen spinach. I added in my spinach frozen (they were spinach nuggets) and separated it as it melted. If its frozen spinach in a box, you might want to thaw it in the microwave beforehand and squeeze out a bit of the excess liquid and measure out 1 cup.Place the chicken breasts back in the spinach/artichoke mixture and simmer all together with the lid off until the chicken is cooked through. The sauce will thicken a bit more as it simmers...just make sure you keep the lid off or it might get watery."

Cover the mushrooms with the sides of your chicken thigh and place folded side down into a baking pan, keeping the mushrooms sealed in the chicken (The toothpicks aren't necessary). They don't fall apart.For this recipe I arranged them on 2 (11x9"") metal pans. Glass baking dishes work well too. Make sure you aren't crowding the pans (the thighs should barely be touching). Once all of the thighs are in the pans, sprinkle a little more Mrs. Dash over the top.Cover the pans with aluminum foil and bake at 350 for 1 hour, then remove the foil, drain off about 75% of the liquid and discard (or keep for gravy) and bake an additional 15 min.

Pork & Ginger Pot Stickers,72,"Peel off the outer leaves from the cabbage. Slice the head in half and remove the core (see photos below). Cut each half into two then cut crosswise as thinly as possible. You need a very small shred to make the pot stickers easy to fill and fold.In a large skillet, heat 2 Tbsp of oil over medium/high heat. When its hot, add the cabbage and  tsp of salt. Saute the cabbage until it is translucent and soft (about 15 minutes). Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.While the cabbage is sauteing (stir every minute or so), combine the raw ground pork, peeled and grated ginger (use a small cheese grater), minced garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, sliced green onion an shredded carrot. Mix them all together well with your hands. Add the shredded and cooked cabbage and mix again until it is evenly incorporated (you almost have to use your hands here). Refrigerate the mixture for at least one hour to let the flavors blend. (The cabbage will release gasses as it refrigerates and smell pretty stinky when you come back to it but dont be afraid. Its still good and the smell will go away when you cook the pot stickers.)Prepare your workspace by getting a small dish of water (used to glue the edges together), something to fold the pot stickers on (I used a cutting board) and something to keep them on once folded (another cutting board or large plate). I used square wrappers so the wrapping technique below is based on that. There are many methods to folding pot stickers/won tons so if you have a different shape, simply do a google search for folding won tons or folding pot stickers to see more methods.To make things easier, fill and fold the wontons in groups. I filled and folded three then moved on to the next group. Take three won ton wrappers and lay them on your surface. Using your finger, wet all the way around the edge of the wrapper. Place about 1 tsp of pork filling in the center of each square. Fold the square over diagonally from one corner to the opposite corner. Press down all along the seam to make the wet edges stick. Squeeze out all of the air in the process.Take the two points of the triangle that are furthest from each other and wrap them around front and pinch together (use a bit more water to glue it together). The pot sticker is now folded! Fold the rest in the same manner. Once all of the pot stickers are folded, you can either cook all of them or freeze some on a cookie sheet. Once they are completely frozen solid, transfer them to an air tight freezer bag for storage. You can take them out and cook them as usual at a later date!In a large pot, bring 6 cups of water and 3 bouillon cubes to a boil. Once it reaches a hard boil, drop in about half of the pot stickers. Boil them until they begin to float (about 7 minutes) then transfer to a cooling rack to drain. Place a baking sheet under the cooling rack to catch any water that drips off.Once the pot stickers are done boiling and have drained for a minute or two they are ready to fry. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium/high heat. Spray it generously with non-stick spray. Using a non-stick pan with non-stick spray is the easiest way to make the pot stickers crispy without having them stick, tear and use a ton of oil. Pan fry the pot stickers on each side until golden brown and crispy (2-3 min on each side).Serve immediately with your favorite asian sauce (soy, oyster, teriyaki, sweet chili anything goes!)."

(I actually used my pasta maker and it worked really well. I went to the second setting) Use a cookie cutter to cut the dough out into bunnies or circles or really anything you want! Place on a baking sheet and bake for 10-11 minutes. The tops wil begin to turn golden.Remove from the oven and brush with the melted butter and then sprinkle with kosher salt. Allow to cool completely (this only takes about 5 minutes) before filling with the peanut butter.Once the crackers have cooled, use a knife to spread the peanut butter filling on one side and then sandwich with another cracker. Repeat until all the crackers have been used. I had a total of 18 sandwiches (36 crackers). Place the crackers in the freezer for about 10 minutes.In the meantime melt the chocolate in a shallow microwave safe bowl. Melt on high for 30 second intervals stirring each time until melted.Line a baking sheet with wax or parchment paper. Remove three sandwiches from the freezer and dip in the melted chocolate. Use a knife to wipe off any excess chocolate and place on the baking sheet. If you would like to decorate these with sprinkle, do so now. Repeat until you have covered one side of all the sandwiches. After you have done all the sandwiches place them back in the freezer for anther 10 minutes. Remove and dip the other side in the melted chocolate.

Stir barley, Cheddar cheese, mushrooms, onion, red bell pepper, parsley, eggs, garlic, salt, and black pepper into mashed black beans. Mix enough bread crumbs into bean mixture to form a sticky batter that holds together.                            Divide batter into 4 to 6 patties; place on prepared aluminum foil.                            Grill patties on the aluminum foil for about 8 minutes on each side.                                                Kitchen-Friendly View"
