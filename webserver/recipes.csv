Softbatch Funfetti Sugar Cookies,11,"To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter, sugar, egg, extract, and beat on medium-high speed until well-creamed, light and fluffy, about 5 minutes (or use a hand mixer and beat for at least 7 minutes). Do not shortcut the creaming process; make sure dough is very light in color and fluff, stop to scrape down the sides of the mixer as necessary. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, optional salt, and mix until just combined, about 1 minute. Add the sprinkles and beat momentarily to incorporate, less than 1 minute, or fold in by hand. Using a medium 2-inch cookie scoop, form heaping two tablespoon mounds (I made 15). Place mounds on a large plate, flatten mounds slightly with your palm, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 5 days, before baking. Do not bake with warm dough because cookies will spread and bake thinner and flatter. Preheat oven to 350F, line two baking sheets with Silpats, or spray with cooking spray. Place mounds on baking sheets, spaced at least 2 inches apart (I bake 8 cookies per sheet). Bake for 8 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just beginning to set, even if undercooked, pale, and glossy in the center. These cookies should not turn golden or brown at all and should stay white. Do not bake longer than 9 minutes for soft cookies because they firm up as they cool (The cookies shown in the photos were baked with dough that had been chilled overnight, allowed to come to room temp for 15 minutes, and were baked for 8 minutes, with trays rotated at the 4-minute mark). Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before removing and transferring to a rack to finish cooling. Store cookies airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored airtight in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.

Chocolate Chia Pudding Parfaits,25,"Prepare the pudding ahead of time by combining 1 cup milk, chia seeds, maple syrup, and vanilla extract in a medium bowl. Sift in the cocoa powder to remove any clumps, then whisk vigorously until all of the ingredients are incorporated (the cocoa powder is sometimes stubborn during this step, but I find tilting the bowl to the side helps the liquid absorb it more quickly). Place the chocolate chia pudding mixture in a lidded container and refrigerate at least two hours or overnight to thicken. Stir occasionally as it chills. Prior to serving, blend the frozen banana slices and 1/3 cup of milk together in a high-powered blender, adding more milk, a tablespoon at a time, as needed to blend. (You may, as an alternative, use a food processor to make a banana puree. In this instance, the milk may not be necessary at all.)To serve, place the chocolate chia pudding, banana puree, and strawberries in 2 tall glasses or jars in alternating layers. Garnish with a strawberry on top if you want it to be fancy schmancy."

In a separate large bowl, whisk together the eggs and buttermilk and then whisk the egg mixture into the flour mixture just until combined. Slice the apples into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Using the cookie cutters, cut each apple slice into rings, discarding the center core. Add 3 inches of oil to a large heavy-bottomed pot set over medium heat. Line a sheet tray with paper towels.When the oil reaches 350F on your deep-fry thermometer, begin by dipping each apple slice in the batter, shaking off any excess then carefully lowering it into the oil.

Flip the apple slices occasionally so that they brown on all sides then using tongs, transfer them onto the paper towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat the battering and frying process with the remaining apple rings.Serve the apple rings immediately with caramel sauce for dipping.Kellys Notes:You can coat the fried apple rings in cinnamon and sugar rather than serve them with caramel sauce.It's important to shake off as much excess batter as possible to ensure the apple rings fry quickly.The apple rings will soften slightly as they cool, so it's best to serve them immediately while they retain a slight crunch."

Strawberry Ricotta Scones,47,"1. Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a Silpat baking mat and set aside.2. Whisk together the egg, buttermilk, lemon juice, and vanilla in a medium bowl. Add the ricotta cheese and whisk until combined. There will still be a few lumps. Set aside.3. In a small bowl, combine the sugar and lemon zest. Rub together with your fingers until fragrant. In another large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and lemon sugar mixture.  Add the butter pieces to the flour mixture and toss with a fork just until the butter is coated with flour. Using a pastry cutter, fork, or your hands, cut the butter into the flour until you have a mixture of pea-sized or slightly larger clumps of butter and flour.4. Pour the liquid ingredients over the dry ingredients and stir with a spatula until just combined.  Don’t overmix the dough. Gently fold in the strawberries. Turn out the dough onto a well floured space and gently and shortly knead the dough. If the dough is too sticky, you can add a little bit of flour as you knead. Pat the dough down into a disk, about 1/2 inch thick. Cut the dough into 8 wedges or cut into rounds with a biscuit or cookie cutter.5. Transfer the scones to the prepared baking sheet and brush with milk or heavy cream. Sprinkle scones with turbinado sugar. Bake for about 15-20 mins, or until the scones are golden brown. Let cool on a wire rack and serve.Note-the dough is sticky due to the ricotta cheese. You might have to add more flour when kneading. Just try to be gentle and not overwork the dough."

Cavatelli with Slow Roasted Broccoli and Harissa,49,"Heat the olive oil over medium heat in your largest skillet. Add the garlic and saute for about 20 seconds. Add the broccoli, harissa, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and reduce heat to medium low. Cook, turning occasionally, until the broccoli is completely tender and meltingly delicious - I've been known to let this go for 45 minutes or more. Add a little more olive oil during the process if it seems advisable.Put aside four bowls to warm.Bring a large pot of well-salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the pasta until al dente. Transfer to the skillet with the broccoli, reserving a cup of the pasta water. Raise the heat to medium-high. Toss the pasta with the broccoli. If it seems a little dry, drizzle in some of the pasta water to develop a bit of moistness and shine. Taste and adjust seasoning; it will probably need more salt. Stir in the parsley and mint. Divide the pasta among the preheated bowls, hit with a few flakes of Maldon salt and some freshly ground pepper, and serve immediately, passing the Parmesan cheese at the table if using."
Peach Upside Down Cake,50,"Grease an 8-inch cake pan, then line it with an 8-inch parchment round, also greased.Peel the peaches. This can be accomplished easily if you blanch the peaches first. This will loosen their skin and the task is not nearly as messy as it would be with a knife.Prepare an ice bath in a large bowl large enough for all the peaches. With a paring knife, lightly score an X onto the bottom of each peach. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Carefully drop the peaches into the water for 1 to 2 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, move the peaches into to an ice-water bath to stop the cooking. Once the peaches have cooled, the skin should peel off easily. Slice each peach in half, remove its pit and cut each half into appropriately sized wedges.Prepare the topping. Melt the butter and brown sugar. Pour this mixture, while still warm, onto the bottom of the lined cake pan. Arrange the peach slices in an attractive circular pattern all around the bottom of the pan. Set it aside while you prepare the batter.Pre-heat the oven to 350 degree F. Cream butter and sugar together until light and creamy. Beat in the egg one at a time until well combined.Add in vanilla and orange zest. Sift flour, baking powder and salt together. Slow down the mixer and slowly add in the flour alternately with the 2 tbsp of milk. Mix until combined.Spread the batter over the peaches and bake the cake for 50 minutes or until golden brown, and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes. If it has a particularly large hump in the center cut this off with a serrated knife. You will get a better presentation if the cake sits flat and solid. Set a serving plate over the top of the cake pan. Using kitchen mitts because the pan will still be quite warm, invert the caked quickly. Let it sit undisturbed until you are confident it has removed itself from the bottom of the pan.  Remove the pan and carefully peel away the parchment paper. You may need to slightly adjust the peaches to make the presentation as pretty as possible. Serve warm with barely sweetened whipped cream on the side.Share this:ShareGoogleTwitterPinterestFacebookLike this:Like Loading..."

Oatmeal Pumpkin Seed Bread,72,"1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Split pumpkin in half starting at the stem and place cut side down on a silicone mat or a lightly greased cookie sheet. Bake for 45 minutes. The pumpkin should be very soft all the way through when poked with a knife. Cool slightly before scooping out the seeds. Scoop out the roasted flesh of the pumpkin and mash it with a fork or puree it in your food processor. Set aside 1 cup for the dough and reserve the rest for other recipes that utilize pumpkin puree.2. Mixing and storing the dough: Mix the yeast and salt with the water, melted butter and honey in a 5-quart bowl, or a lidded (not airtight) food container.3. Mix in oatmeal, pumpkin, and flours without kneading, using a spoon, a 14-cup capacity food processor (with dough attachment), or a heavy-duty stand mixer (with a dough hook). If you're not using a machine, you may need to use wet hands to incorporate the last bit of flour.4. Cover (not airtight) and allow to rest at room temperature until the dough rises and collapses (or flattens on top), approximately 2 hours. (I moved mine to a clean, lightly oiled bowl and covered it with a dish towel).5. The dough can be used immediately after the initial rise, though it is easier to handle when cold. Refrigerate in a lidded (not airtight) container and use over the next 9 days.6. On baking day: Lightly grease 9x5x3-inch nonstick loaf pan. Dust the surface of the refrigerated dough with flour and cut off a 1 1/2 pound cantaloupe-sized piece. Dust the piece with flour and quickly shape it into a ball by stretching the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all sides, rotating the ball a quarter- turn as you go.7. Flatten the dough with your hands and roll out into a 1/2-inch-thick rectangle. As you roll out the dough, use enough flour to prevent it from sticking to the work surface but not so much as to make the dough dry.8. Sprinkle seeds and cranberries over the dough and roll the dough up to encase them. Fold the dough over again to work the seeds into the dough.9. Using a small amount of flour, form the dough into a loaf shape. Place the loaf in the prepared pan and allow to rest and rise for 2 hours (or just 40 minutes if you're using fresh, unrefrigerated dough).10. Twenty minutes before baking time, preheat the oven to 350°F., and place an empty broiler tray on any other shelf that won't interfere with the rising bread.11. Just before putting bread in the oven, brush the loaf with egg wash (I sprinkled additional pepitas on top too), and place it on a rack near the center of the oven. Pour 1 cup of hot tap water into the broiler tray and quickly close the oven door. Bake the loaf for 45 to 50 minutes, until deeply browned and firm.12. Allow to cool before slicing or eating."
